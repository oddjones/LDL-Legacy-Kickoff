FORMS
=====


LOOK & FEEL
-----------

* The form is missing an overall "style" other than the basics - it could really do with a proper heirarchical layout drawing up.
* Different renders - we only use the "form-horizontal" render, which can prove problematic with some form layouts




VALIDATION
----------

* Change standard (mandatory field) validation text messages to red borders and placeholders/ticks
