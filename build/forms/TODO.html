<h1>FORMS</h1>

<h2>LOOK &amp; FEEL</h2>

<ul>
<li>The form is missing an overall &ldquo;style&rdquo; other than the basics - it could really do with a proper heirarchical layout drawing up.</li>
<li>Different renders - we only use the &ldquo;form-horizontal&rdquo; render, which can prove problematic with some form layouts</li>
</ul>


<h2>VALIDATION</h2>

<ul>
<li>Change standard (mandatory field) validation text messages to red borders and placeholders/ticks</li>
</ul>
