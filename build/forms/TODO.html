<h1>FORMS</h1>

<h2>LOOK &amp; FEEL</h2>

<p><em>The form is missing an overall &ldquo;style&rdquo; other than the basics - it could really do with a proper heirarchical layout drawing up.
</em>Different renders - we only use the &ldquo;form-horizontal&rdquo; render, which can prove problematic with some form layouts</p>

<h2>VALIDATION</h2>

<ul>
<li>Change standard validation text messages to red borders and placeholders/ticks</li>
</ul>
