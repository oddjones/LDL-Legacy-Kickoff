<h1>FORMS</h1>

<h2>LOOK &amp; FEEL</h2>

<blockquote><p>The form is missing an overall &ldquo;style&rdquo; other than the basics - it could really do with a proper heirarchical layout drawing up.
Different renders - we only use the &ldquo;form-horizontal&rdquo; render, which can prove problematic with some form layouts</p></blockquote>

<h2>VALIDATION</h2>

<blockquote><p>Change standard validation text messages to red borders and placeholders/ticks</p></blockquote>
